# Project3-Hypoglycemia-Prediction-with-SVRs-and-SVMs
Diabetes Management project

dear all,

pay attention to the patient_root folder (change user name and put the folder of data in the desktop):

    patient_root = "/Users/<USERNAME>/Desktop/Ohio Data/Ohio2020_processed/train/596-ws-training_processed.csv"  # TODO: path to csv file
    patient_root_test = "/Users/<USERNAME>/Desktop/Ohio Data/Ohio2020_processed/test/596-ws-testing_processed.csv"  # TODO: path to csv file

Then just run and you will get 3 plots: 
- Blood glucose prediction with SVR
- Regressions
- Hypoglycaemic event prediction
